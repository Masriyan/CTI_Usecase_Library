**A comprehensive collection of practical Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) use cases designed to help security teams implement effective threat intelligence programs.**

</div>

## 📋 Overview

The CTI Use Case Library provides battle-tested, actionable use cases across three core CTI disciplines. Each use case includes detailed workflows, acceptance criteria, and MITRE ATT&CK mappings to help CTI analysts and security teams operationalize threat intelligence effectively.

This library serves as a practical companion to the [CTI Product Assessment Matrix](https://github.com/Masriyan/CTI-Product-Assesment-Matrix), helping teams understand not just which tools to use, but how to apply them to solve real-world security challenges.

## 📂 Use Case Categories

### 🔍 Threat Hunting & Detection

Proactive use cases focused on identifying threats within your environment. These use cases help security teams:
- 🎯 Hunt for suspicious activities and behaviors
- 🚨 Develop and validate detection rules
- 🔎 Identify indicators of compromise (IOCs)
- 🕵️ Investigate security incidents
- 🗺️ Map threats to MITRE ATT&CK techniques

**Directory:** `threat-hunting-detection/` | **Use Cases:** 8

### 🛡️ Vulnerability Intelligence

Use cases centered on managing and prioritizing vulnerability remediation through threat intelligence. These use cases enable teams to:
- ⚡ Prioritize vulnerabilities based on active exploitation
- 👥 Track threat actor targeting of specific vulnerabilities
- ⏱️ Monitor vulnerability disclosure and exploitation timelines
- 🔗 Correlate vulnerability data with threat campaigns
- 📊 Make risk-based patching decisions

**Directory:** `vulnerability-intelligence/` | **Use Cases:** 7

### 📈 Strategic Intelligence & Reporting

High-level use cases for producing actionable intelligence for leadership and strategic decision-making. These use cases support:
- 👔 Executive threat briefings and reporting
- 🏢 Industry-specific threat landscape analysis
- 🎭 Threat actor profiling and tracking
- ⚖️ Risk assessment and forecasting
- 💼 Security investment justification

**Directory:** `strategic-intelligence-reporting/` | **Use Cases:** 7

## 📑 Use Case Index

This section will contain a comprehensive index of all use cases organized by category. The index will be automatically generated and maintained as use cases are added to the library.

*Index coming soon - use cases will be populated in subsequent phases.*

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 👨‍💻 For CTI Analysts

1. 📁 Browse the category that matches your current focus area
2. 🎯 Select a use case relevant to your objectives
3. 📖 Review the workflow, inputs, and acceptance criteria
4. 🔧 Adapt the use case to your organization's specific context
5. ♻️ Implement and iterate based on results

### 👔 For Security Leaders
