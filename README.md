# CTI Use Case Library

A comprehensive collection of practical Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) use cases designed to help security teams implement effective threat intelligence programs.

## Overview

The CTI Use Case Library provides battle-tested, actionable use cases across three core CTI disciplines. Each use case includes detailed workflows, acceptance criteria, and MITRE ATT&CK mappings to help CTI analysts and security teams operationalize threat intelligence effectively.

This library serves as a practical companion to the [CTI Product Assessment Matrix](https://github.com/Masriyan/CTI-Product-Assesment-Matrix), helping teams understand not just which tools to use, but how to apply them to solve real-world security challenges.

## Use Case Categories

### Threat Hunting & Detection

Proactive use cases focused on identifying threats within your environment. These use cases help security teams:
- Hunt for suspicious activities and behaviors
- Develop and validate detection rules
- Identify indicators of compromise (IOCs)
- Investigate security incidents
- Map threats to MITRE ATT&CK techniques

**Directory:** `threat-hunting-detection/`

### Vulnerability Intelligence

Use cases centered on managing and prioritizing vulnerability remediation through threat intelligence. These use cases enable teams to:
- Prioritize vulnerabilities based on active exploitation
- Track threat actor targeting of specific vulnerabilities
- Monitor vulnerability disclosure and exploitation timelines
- Correlate vulnerability data with threat campaigns
- Make risk-based patching decisions

**Directory:** `vulnerability-intelligence/`

### Strategic Intelligence & Reporting

High-level use cases for producing actionable intelligence for leadership and strategic decision-making. These use cases support:
- Executive threat briefings and reporting
- Industry-specific threat landscape analysis
- Threat actor profiling and tracking
- Risk assessment and forecasting
- Security investment justification

**Directory:** `strategic-intelligence-reporting/`

## Use Case Index

This section will contain a comprehensive index of all use cases organized by category. The index will be automatically generated and maintained as use cases are added to the library.

*Index coming soon - use cases will be populated in subsequent phases.*

## Quick Start

### For CTI Analysts

1. Browse the category that matches your current focus area
2. Select a use case relevant to your objectives
3. Review the workflow, inputs, and acceptance criteria
4. Adapt the use case to your organization's specific context
5. Implement and iterate based on results

### For Security Leaders

1. Review use cases to understand CTI capabilities and value
2. Use the acceptance criteria to evaluate team performance
3. Reference use cases when scoping CTI tool requirements
4. Cross-reference with the [CTI Product Assessment Matrix](https://github.com/Masriyan/CTI-Product-Assesment-Matrix) for tooling decisions
